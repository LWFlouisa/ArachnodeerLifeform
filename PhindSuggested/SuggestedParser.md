To implement a text parser for a Ruby-based logic DSL without using an external library, you can leverage the metaprogramming capabilities of Ruby to create your own parser. By using Ruby's syntax and metaprogramming techniques, you can define a domain-specific language (DSL) for your logic rules and queries.

Here are some possible ways to implement the text parser:

1. **Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)**: You can implement a parser using a Parsing Expression Grammar approach. PEGs are a powerful parsing technique that allows you to define a grammar using rules and expressions. Ruby has libraries like Treetop that provide a parsing DSL based on PEGs. You can define your grammar rules and expressions using Treetop and generate a parser for your logic DSL.

2. **Hand-written Parser**: Another approach is to implement a hand-written parser in Ruby. This involves writing code that examines the input text character by character and applies specific rules to recognize and interpret the logic statements. This approach requires a good understanding of parsing techniques and can be more complex to implement than using a parser generator. However, it gives you full control over the parsing process.

3. **Internal DSL**: Instead of creating a separate parser, you can leverage Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities to create an internal DSL. An internal DSL uses the existing syntax of the host language (Ruby in this case) to define a domain-specific language. By defining appropriate methods, classes, and modules, you can create a DSL that provides a natural and expressive way to write logic rules and queries. This approach eliminates the need for a separate parser and integrates seamlessly with the rest of your Ruby codebase.

Here's a simple example of how an internal DSL for logic rules and queries could look like in Ruby:

```ruby
class LogicDSL
  attr_reader :rules

  def initialize
    @rules = []
  end

  def rule(name, &block)
    rule = Rule.new(name)
    rule.instance_eval(&block)
    rules << rule
  end

  def query(name, &block)
    query = Query.new(name)
    query.instance_eval(&block)
    query.execute
  end
end

class Rule
  attr_reader :name, :conditions

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @conditions = []
  end

  def condition(condition)
    conditions << condition
  end
end

class Query
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def execute
    # Execute the query logic
  end
end

# Example usage
logic = LogicDSL.new

logic.rule "Apple is eaten if fresh" do
  condition "Apple is fresh"
end

logic.query "Is apple eaten?" do
  # Perform the logic query
end
```

In this example, the `LogicDSL` class acts as the entry point for defining logic rules and executing queries. The `rule` method allows you to define a logic rule with conditions, and the `query` method executes a logic query. This DSL can be extended with additional methods and constructs to support more complex logic statements.

It's important to note that these are just examples of possible approaches to implement a text parser for a Ruby-based logic DSL without using an external library. The actual implementation details may vary depending on the complexity and requirements of your logic DSL.

If you have specific requirements or need further assistance with the implementation, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help further.
