Creating an AI system that combines the intelligence of the smartest mammals and insects would be a complex endeavor. The search results provide some insights into the intelligence of different animal species, including mammals like deer and insects like spiders, cockroaches, and ants.

Mammals, such as deer, are known for their cognitive abilities, including problem-solving, social skills, and adaptability. While they may not possess the same level of intelligence as humans, they demonstrate behaviors that are associated with intelligence ([Source 1](https://worlddeer.org/are-deer-smart/)). On the other hand, insects like spiders and cockroaches have unique characteristics and behaviors but are not traditionally considered as intelligent as mammals ([Source 2](https://pestpointers.com/spiders-how-smart-are-they-and-are-they-self-aware/), [Source 3](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/if-cockroaches-are-conscious-would-that-stop-you-from-smushing-them-180947876/)).

In the case of ants, they exhibit remarkable navigation and problem-solving abilities. Ants have a distributed system of specialized modules that interact with each other to produce robust navigation. Their intelligence lies in the way different strategies cleverly interact to navigate their environment ([Source 1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weve-been-looking-at-ant-intelligence-the-wrong-way/)). However, it's important to note that the intelligence of insects, including ants, is still not fully understood, and there is ongoing research in this area.

Creating an AI system that blends the intelligence of mammals and insects would require careful consideration of the specific features and behaviors that are desired. Some potential features of such a system could include:

1. **Problem-solving abilities**: Drawing inspiration from the problem-solving skills of mammals and insects, the AI system could be designed to analyze complex scenarios, identify patterns, and generate solutions.

2. **Adaptability**: Incorporating the adaptability of mammals and insects, the AI system could possess the ability to learn from new situations, adjust its behavior, and make informed decisions based on changing circumstances.

3. **Social skills**: Mammals, such as deer, exhibit social behavior and communication skills. Integrating these aspects into the AI system could enable it to interact with humans or other AI systems effectively.

4. **Navigation and spatial awareness**: Taking cues from the navigational abilities of ants, the AI system could be designed to navigate complex environments, recognize landmarks, and find optimal paths.

5. **Modularity**: Insects have modular nervous systems, with different sub-brains controlling various body parts. Incorporating this concept into the AI system could provide flexibility and efficiency in processing information and controlling different functionalities.

It's important to note that creating an AI system with the intelligence of both mammals and insects is a hypothetical scenario, and the specific capabilities and features would depend on the design choices and the goals of the system. Additionally, the search results did not provide direct information on creating such a system. Therefore, further research and expertise in both AI and animal intelligence would be required to explore and develop such a concept.
