## Use Case
The idea of using a text parser for a Ruby-based logic DSL can indeed be applied to develop a poison detector system to prevent people from getting sick. By defining a DSL that includes rules and queries related to poison detection, you can create a system that analyzes input data and provides warnings or alerts based on the detected poison.

One approach to implementing this without using an external library is to create a custom DSL in Ruby that allows users to define poison detection rules using a natural language-like syntax. The parser would interpret these rules and perform the necessary logic to detect potential sources of poison.

Here's a simplified example of how the DSL could be defined:

```ruby
class PoisonDetectorDSL
  attr_reader :rules

  def initialize
    @rules = []
  end

  def rule(name, &block)
    rule = Rule.new(name)
    rule.instance_eval(&block)
    rules << rule
  end

  def analyze(data)
    # Perform analysis based on the defined rules
    results = []
    rules.each do |rule|
      if rule.applies?(data)
        results << rule.name
      end
    end
    results
  end
end

class Rule
  attr_reader :name, :conditions

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @conditions = []
  end

  def applies?(data)
    # Perform the logic to check if the rule applies to the given data
    # Return true or false based on the conditions
  end

  def condition(condition)
    conditions << condition
  end
end

# Example usage
poison_detector = PoisonDetectorDSL.new

poison_detector.rule "Detect Poison Ivy" do
  condition "data.include?('poison ivy')"
end

poison_detector.rule "Detect Poison Oak" do
  condition "data.include?('poison oak')"
end

data = "Snap a picture of your suspect plant, and our AI will detect if it's poison ivy or poison oak."
results = poison_detector.analyze(data)
puts results
```

In this example, the `PoisonDetectorDSL` class acts as the entry point for defining poison detection rules and performing the analysis. The `rule` method allows you to define a rule with conditions, and the `analyze` method performs the analysis based on the defined rules.

The `Rule` class represents an individual rule with its name and conditions. The `applies?` method is responsible for evaluating whether the rule applies to the given data based on the defined conditions.

Please note that the provided code snippet is a simplified example to illustrate the concept of using a custom DSL for poison detection in Ruby. The actual implementation would require more complexity and consideration of the specific requirements, data sources, and logic for poison detection.

It's also important to mention that the search results did not provide specific examples or techniques for implementing a poison detector system using a text parser in Ruby. Therefore, the provided approach is a suggestion based on the available information.

If you have more specific requirements or need further assistance with the implementation, please provide additional details, and I'll be happy to help further.
